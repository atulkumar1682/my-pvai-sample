 Need to allow https under the default SG in every env so that it can download and need to make changes in CFN templates.

Steps to install the scripts through ansible.
 1. Check the environment( pt,ml,dev,qa,prod,val etc) present on the location cd/opt/application/pvai-playbooks/environments/ . If not create one via cp cmd :( cp -R source destination )
 2. Once we get the environment look for the servers group under vi/opt/application/pvai-playbooks/environments/(env. name)/hosts and do the necessary changes according to the installation.
 3. After changes under hosts file ping the server via the cmd to make sure the changes made on above steps are good to go or not.
 ansible sbd-servers -m ping -i environments/(env. name)/hosts -u centos. 
 Note: If the ping does not comes through due to the ssh issue that means we need to add the ssh key of ansible server on the destination server found on the path vi .ssh/authorized_keys
 4. Once we got the ping that means, we are ready to go for installation.
 5. Go to the location for running the ansible playbook : cd/opt/application/pvai-playbooks/ 
 6. check the scripts presents on the above location that you wanted to run like ( install-filebeat.yml, install-os-hardening.yml)
 7. Go to the script via vi to that script and made changes according to the groups where we want to install ( mentioned on step 2 )
 8. Once done with above step, run the command to run the scrip : ansible-playbook -v install-filebeat.yml -i environments/ml/hosts
 Note: For Filebeat installation, make sure https:443 should be allowed under default SG and need to change the elastic search URL location found on below path
 cd/opt/application/pvai-playbooks/roles/filebeat/default and open the file main.yml and change the es url with Elastic search URL
 9. Now it should be run on the destination location.
 
 ansible-playbook amz-linux-servers -i environments/pt/hosts
