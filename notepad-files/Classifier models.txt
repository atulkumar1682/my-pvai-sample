Confluence Page : Deployment of Classifier Models ( Search string )
S3 bucket location : Amazon S3pvaipfizerdataml1a/models_plus_artifacts  

Steps to deploy models on SBP server.
1. Need to login on a server through which we will deploy the server. As Ansible server is the common server so we will go and login and will deploy through this.
2. Login with devops and go to the location /opt/application/ and create the folder name" sbp-model-deployment " .
3. Create 1 sub-folders under the above created folder named : "models-plus-artifacts" and now need to sync that folder with the location shared by patrick on s3 location. 
generally , this location on s3 as follows : S3pvaipfizerdataml1a/models_plus_artifacts . It is saved on Pfizer account.
4. We can sync via the following cmd : aws s3 sync s3://pvaipfizerdataml1a/models_plus_artifacts/ . --exclude "previous*/*"
5. Now we need to get the tar file saved on pfizer-demo account under pvai-demo-devops s3 bucket with the name : xce_sparkbeyond.tar .
Note: As this is the seperate account with no cross account access so we need to get this bucket downloaded on our system first and than we need to download it on the Server.
