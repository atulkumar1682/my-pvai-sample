Need to check the entry under /etc/hosts for the server ip
Need to change the RDS entry on below path.
:cd ~/wildfly-10.1.0.Final/standalone/configuration$ vi standalone-full.xml
Rge-Verification steps :
	Connect to VPN created for the environment in section 4.10.
o	Launch verification URL http://<serverIP>:8080
o	Login with admin credential. 

Note: To make sure there will be below entry for logs under filebeat.yml like below.
"/home/ubuntu/wildfly-10.1.0.Final/standalone/log/server.log
"/home/ubuntu/wildfly-10.1.0.Final/rage/logs/*.log"
"/home/ubuntu/wildfly-10.1.0.Final/ci/SemanticExtraction/Rage_Process_Logs/*.txt"

After that we need to run standalone.sh to start the jboss service. It will be present on below location.
home/ubuntu/wildfly-10.1.0.Final/bin/
Run the above find .sh command in cmd in background like this:  nohup ./standalone.sh > run.log &
Once done we can check the jboss service status via the cmd : netstat -lntp | grep 80 ( as it runs on port 8080 )
However if we dont find it, we can run the following cmd to find the location.
sudo find / -name "standalone.sh"

Key Points

find . -type f -name "*.doc"
find . -type f -name "*.doc" -exec cp -t s3cp/ {} +
we can do the tail -f run.log to see the job running.

Check the services ( filebeat,chrony,ds agent ) and need to change the elasticsearch endpoint under filebeat.xml file present on /etc/filebeat/filebeat.xml 

nohup aws s3 sync . s3://pvaipfizerdataml1a/ocr-data1/ --exclude "*" --include "*.doc" --include "*.docx" --include "*.ppt" --include "*.pptx" --include "*.xlsx" --acl authenticated-read &

aws s3 cp pvai-ansible-playbooks.tar "s3://pvai-app-deployment/Intake 1.0/ansible-playbooks/" --acl authenticated-read
